# Abraxas Engine II
Abraxas Engine is my multi-genre game engine, heavily in development, written completely in java because I love torturing myself. Open sourced in case you'd like to torture yourself too!
## Story
Abraxas Engine was originally the name of my CompSci thesis project. It was a platformer written in C# using XNA Framework for rendering. I love the name, Abraxas was the name of the antagonist, so I decided to name the subsequent versions of the engine after it.
## Capabilities
* Right now, it can produce a fairly standard VN, which was the original purpose of this engine.
* In February 2025 I ported a Raycasting engine to this code, originally called RayCastMeADream, so it can make a First Person game too. Good shit.
# What's working
* Menu
* Can advance text on the VN section
* Raycaster works and you can navigate the farily simple map
* 2025/03/23: We've got sounds now!
# ToDo
Generally speaking
* VN: Choices for branching paths. It's prototyped but it ain't working
* Raycaster: navigation and collisions are done, but I need to do pickups, weapons, etc.

Kanban of the project in case you'd like to know how shit is going on
